Employee Burnout Analysis and Prediction

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict employee burnout levels using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify patterns and key factors contributing to burnout and provide actionable insights to mitigate it. The dataset includes employee-related data such as work hours, availability of WFH setup, and more.

Features of the Project

Data Cleaning: Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Key insights are visualized using plots, including correlations and distribution analysis.

Machine Learning Model: A Random Forest Regressor is trained to predict burnout levels.

Evaluation Metrics: Metrics like R-squared (R²) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used to evaluate model performance.
